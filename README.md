## Project Motivation
The Secure Vault project was developed as a practical implementation of encryption and secure file management techniques. It emphasizes privacy and data integrity, making it ideal for anyone needing a simple and secure way to manage sensitive files.



  ## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **Cryptography**: For AES-256 encryption and SHA hashing.
- **PBKDF2**: For password-based key derivation.
- **Git**: Version control.


Secure Vault is a Python-based file management system designed for securely storing, encrypting, and managing files. It uses advanced encryption techniques to protect your data and provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for interaction.

## Features

-> **Create Encrypted Vaults:** Users can create vaults with a password to securely store files.

-> **Metadata Handling:** Securely stores file metadata, such as file offsets, sizes, and hashes.

-> **Padding for Security:** Vault files are padded to hide their true size, improving security.

-> **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Tkinter, the GUI provides a user-friendly experience.


## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the Secure Vault project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/selimyilbas/secure-vault.git
cd secure-vault
```


### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```


Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install pillow
pip install cryptography
```

### 4. Run the Application
   
Start the Secure Vault GUI:

```
python3 gui.py
```

## Usage

-> **Create a Vault:** Enter a vault path and password, then click "Create Vault."

-> **Open a Vault:** Use the same vault path and password to access an existing vault.

-> **Add Files:** Add files to the vault for encryption.

-> **Extract Files:** Extract encrypted files back to their original state.

-> **Lock Vault:** Securely lock the vault when you're done.

-> **Exit the Application**

-> Simply close the GUI window to exit.
